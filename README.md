# SNiFF
Stands for Simple Nice Flexible Framework.
It is the small, minimalist, and lightweight PHP framework
with the MVC pattern.

This framework doesn't mean to compete with or become like
other popular PHP frameworks out there. It has its own goals
to be always simple, lightweight, easy to use, easy to learn,
and giving room for the developers' freedom in building their
web application but still holding on the MVC standard.

Currently under heavy development in the core, examples, and
also the documentation.
More useful information will be coming soon.
