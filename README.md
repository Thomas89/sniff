# SNiFF
Stands for Simple Nice Flexible Framework.
It is the small, minimalist, and lightweight PHP framework
with MVC pattern.

This framework doesn't mean to compete with other framework.
It has the own goals to be a simple, lightweight, easy to use,
easy to learn, and giving a big freedom for the developers in
building the application with it but still holding on the
MVC standard.

Currently under development in the core, examples, and
also the documentation.
More useful information will be coming soon.
